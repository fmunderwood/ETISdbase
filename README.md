# ETISdbaseRCode
An R package containing functions to create outputs from the [ETIS database](https://www.etis-testing.org).
This package is used in conjunction with the code in the GitHub repository [fmunderwood/ETISdbaseRCode](https://github.com/fmunderwood/ETISdbaseRCode)

The functions calculate seizures and weights in and out when dealing with multiple countries of origin.

The outputs are summary tables and plots of ETIS data for ETIS administrators and ETIS country reports. The outputs are 
either stored directly in the database or are stored as files which can be accessed by the database

These scripts were written by RW Burn under [Darwin Initiative Project 17-020](http://www.darwininitiative.org.uk/project/17020/) 
and [Fiona M Underwood](http://www.fmunderwood.com)

Next steps:
* Testing by Angus to check this works
* Once it is working the package will be used in the ETIS database 
* The package will be maintained from this repository
